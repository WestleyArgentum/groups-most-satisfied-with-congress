          The visualization below shows positions taken by groups on bills from the 112th Congress (2011&ndash; 2013) that came up for a vote in at least one chamber. The theory is, by looking at the number of bills supported / opposed by a given group, we can estimate its level of engagement and gauge whether events in Congress are working for or against the groups' interests. By focusing on bills that made it all the way to a vote, hopefully we're filtering out bills introduced as symbolic gestures or used for political grandstanding.

          The data for this visualization comes from <a href="http://maplight.org/">Maplight</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. The CRP, as part of its <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php">Open Data Initiative</a>, compiles and releases large bungles of campaign finance data. Maplight pulls in that data and references the contributions by different organizations while <a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill">painstakingly cataloging</a> those organizations support and opposition to versions of proposed bills.

            Perhaps the most striking thing about the above visualization is how polarizing it is. The vast majority of groups take either consistently supportive or consistently oppositional positions &mdash; hardly any do a signifigant amount of both. Filtered differently, to show the biggest supporters and the biggest opposers, we can at last get a sense for whom things in the 112th Congress went well, and for whom it was a struggle.
